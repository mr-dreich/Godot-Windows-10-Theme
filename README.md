# Godot Windows 10 Theme and Viewer

I created a small Godot Application that displays Godot Themes when put into the themes folder along side the executable.

I also created a Windows 10 Theme for Godot, its still a WIP, but very functional. Hasn't been tested as an Editor theme.

The download includes both Light and Dark themes.

Just place the theme folder within the Res:// of your project.
